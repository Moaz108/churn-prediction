Churn Prediction

(Overview)
This repository contains code and resources for predicting customer churn in a business. Churn prediction is a crucial task for businesses to identify and retain valuable customers. The provided machine learning models aim to predict whether a customer is likely to churn based on historical data.

(Features)
Data Cleaning: Explore and clean the dataset to prepare it for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand the patterns and relationships within the data.
Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training: Train machine learning models for churn prediction.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate model performance using relevant metrics.
Deployment: Deploy the trained model for real-time predictions.


(Requirements)
1-Python 3.x
2-Jupyter Notebooks
3-Additional dependencies listed in requirements.txt
